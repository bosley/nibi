# Ensure `build` exists and then cd there.. cmake a release

# Build the release and install the software 

# Then, back out and go into modules

  # iterate over all folders and if CMakeLists.txt exist we need to build the lib, copy the .lib
  # one dir up, then delete the build folder.

  # Once built (if needed) install to NIBI_PATH
