# Tests to make: 


## scanner

From input.hpp we need to have a test that implements a `scanner_cb_if` and then test to ensure
all the correct tokens are parsed (from token.pp)

## list

From list.hpp implement a `list_cb_if` that is handed to `list_builder_c`. From this we can 
ensure the correct lists are built from tokens or source directly
